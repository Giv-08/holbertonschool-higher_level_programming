# HBNB (Holberton Bed and Breakfast) Project

### Overview
HBnB is a platform designed to connect property owners with potential guests, facilitating short-term rentals and unique accommodation experiences. The application encompasses several key functionalities:

User Management: Allowing users to register, update their profiles, and operate as either guests or hosts.
Place Management: Enabling hosts to list their properties with details such as description, price, and location.
Review System: Facilitating guest feedback through ratings and comments on their stays.
Amenity Management: Associating various amenities with listed properties to enhance guest experiences.

### Technical Architecture
The HBnB application is built on a three-layered architecture, ensuring modularity, scalability, and maintainability:

Presentation Layer: Handles user interactions through services and API endpoints, managing input/output and user interface elements.
Business Logic Layer: Contains the core models (User, Place, Review, Amenity) and implements the rules governing the platform's functionality.
Persistence Layer: Manages data storage and retrieval, interfacing with the database to perform CRUD operations.
